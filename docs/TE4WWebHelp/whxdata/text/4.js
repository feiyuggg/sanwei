PhotoMesh results can be generated in standard 3D model (3DML, OSGB, DAE, OBJ), raster (Orthophoto, DSM, DTM) and point cloud (LAS) formats. The 3DML format can be transformed into powerful geospatial data that fully supports spatial operations and attribute queries, by loading it into TerraExplorer and merging it with classification information.","\n\n\n"],"5":["PhotoMesh"],"id":"4"})
