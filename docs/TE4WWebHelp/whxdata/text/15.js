Users can customize the database with data from a network, local drive or the Internet. Overlaying data specific to the user’s requirements onto a 3D map creates a targeted, interactive picture that can meet the needs of a diverse user base and the specific requirements of each individual user. Skyline’s client applications can be used in a local desktop environment, accessing terrain and content data directly, or in a network environment via the SkylineGlobe server.","\n\n\n"],"4":["Clients"],"id":"15"})
